First of all in the program you have to make a choice

1) Analyze "File.txt"
2) insert a name on a existing file to analyze

I write the function to read a file because it is essential to the program

The next step was to clean the text with the punctuation character with a function

This function def CleanWord(app) wasn't required but i wrote it


Later I call the function required 

that search all the word in the text, later search all the sequence of two words and later 3, 4, 5 words

I put every every sequence in a dictionary and everytime i found a sequence I search if it is exists in the dictionary or not


later I extract the first 20 occurrence of words and I put them in a List
[[Number_of_word, sentence_to_print]]

and At the ent I sorted and later scanned the list to see the result



Maybe I don't understand the last part of the exercise and later I supposed this 3 things

1: I don't unterstand what is the weight so for me it was the value of
		Number_of_Words * Number_of_Occurrence
   like i saw in the example

2: I don't unterstand in which order to print the "top list" 
   like the example I decided to print in order to the number of  
   word in a occurrence
